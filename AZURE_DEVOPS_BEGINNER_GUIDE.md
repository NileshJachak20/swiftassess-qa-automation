## üÜò **Troubleshooting Common Issues**

### Issue 1: "Pipeline not found" or "File not found"

**Solution:**
- Make sure `azure-pipelines.yml` is in the **root** of your repository
- Check the file name is exactly `azure-pipelines.yml` (not `.yaml`)
- Make sure you selected the correct branch

### Issue 2: "Failed to install dependencies"

**Solution:**
- This is usually temporary - click **"Run new"** to retry
- Check if `requirements.txt` exists in repository
- Check if `package.json` exists in repository

### Issue 3: "Tests are failing"

**Solution:**
- Don't worry! This might be expected if:
  - Test environment is not accessible
  - Test data needs updating
  - Tests need configuration
- Download screenshots to see what happened
- Review logs for error messages

### Issue 4: "Pipeline is taking too long"

**Solution:**
- First run is always slower (downloads everything)
- Expected time: 45-60 minutes
- Subsequent runs will be faster
- This is normal for comprehensive testing

### Issue 5: "Can't push to repository"

**Solution:**
- Make sure you're authenticated
- In Azure Repos: Use Git credential manager
- In GitHub: Use personal access token or SSH key
- Try the web upload method instead
